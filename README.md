# EnergyBarCalendar
This calendar uses the Google Calendar API to read in your events and also allows you to create a todo list.
Using this list it can create study blocks for you to intuitively study and take breaks.
Extra time is alloted for assignments if there are spaces in your schedule. You can also indicate priority for your tasks (possible extension).
